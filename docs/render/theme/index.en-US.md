### Set The Theme

In different business scenarios, we may be faced with setting themes on the canvas. According to the "Graph Visual Analysis Design Guidelines", Graphin has built-in two default themes: night and day. The theme setting can be completed by setting `<Graphin theme={}/>` as shown in the following API interface.

> Note ‚ö†Ô∏è: Graphin is currently unable to switch the theme, that is, set the theme to the React `state` and change dynamically. It is expected to be added in version `2.1.0`. At the same time, for the components in GraphinComponents, Theme cannot be automatically switched for the time being, and it is expected to be added in version `2.2.0`.

### üîß Tool Functions

We also provide the `Utils` function, which users can configure through themes to generate element styles. In Graphin's official default style, these tool functions are also used to deepen the default style.

```jsx | pure
import { Utils } from '@antv/graphin';

const nodeStyle = Utils.getNodeStyleByTheme({
  primaryColor: 'red',
  nodeSize: 12,
  mode: 'dark',
});

const edgeStyle = Utils.getEdgeStyleByTheme({
  primaryEdgeColor: 'red',
  edgeSize: 12,
  mode: 'dark',
});

const comboStyle = Utils.getComboStyleByTheme();
```

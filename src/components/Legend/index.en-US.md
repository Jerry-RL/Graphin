# Legend

> Note⚠️: Starting from graphin version 2.6.0, we have built this component from `@antv/graphin-components` into `@antv/graphin`, please refer to [release documentation](https://www.yuque .com/antv/gi/gstoyh)

Legend is a common graph analysis companion component, which usually colors nodes and edges after categorizing them to facilitate interactive analysis by users. Clicking on a legend results in two behaviors: highlighting, which highlights the node corresponding to the selected legend; and filtering, which hides the unselected nodes.

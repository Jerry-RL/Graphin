# Tooltip

> Note⚠️: Starting from graphin version 2.6.0, we have built this component from `@antv/graphin-components` into `@antv/graphin`, please refer to [release documentation](https://www.yuque .com/antv/gi/gstoyh)

Tooltip is an interactive component for quickly accessing nodes or edges information. By hovering over a node or edge, a display box appears with detailed information about an element. The tooltip disappears on mouse leave.

# ContextMenu

> Note⚠️: Starting from graphin version 2.6.0, we have built this component from `@antv/graphin-components` into `@antv/graphin`, please refer to [release documentation](https://www.yuque .com/antv/gi/gstoyh)

ContextMenu is a right-click menu, usually for further operations on nodes. For example - node copy, delete, reverse selection, etc. More advanced operations can be supported such as marking a node, data analysis, diffusion of relationship, or sending a data request based on the selected node information. The right-click menu for a graph analysis tool is similar to the right-click menu of the browser webpage in interaction and display form, but it can also display other special designs such as a dashboard-shaped menu.
